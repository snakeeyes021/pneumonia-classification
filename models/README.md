# Download the models

The models for this project exceed the allowable upload size for GitHub. After downloading the models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12PoNMt0KcvdJAF_bHq02brjF5pAS8n1r?usp=sharing), place them in the models folder in order to use them with the notebook.

Note: The ResNet file will need to be unzipped before use.
