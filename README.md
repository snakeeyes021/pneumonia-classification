## Business Problem

The amount of images being produced has been disproportional to the amount of qualified specialists who can read them.  To relief some of the burden on the medical system, machine learning is proposed to assist with this task.

Metrics we care about:
Accuracy
False Negatives - This matter because we don't want to tell them they are nott sick but they are
False Positives - This matter because the treatment for bacterial pneumonia is anti-biotics. Antibacterial resistance is becoming a global threat. More and more research is being published on it. Overprescribing antibiotics is a big part of this problem.
