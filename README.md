Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs that affects the air sacs (alveoli). According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pneumonia-basics): "It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in your lungs (your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream." Anyone of any age can get this infection and it can be caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. If the pneumonia is caused by bacteria or a virus, it can become contagious. Unfortunately, infants and elderly patients over age 65 are at a higher risk. 

## Business Problem

The amount of images being produced has been disproportional to the amount of qualified specialists who can read them.  To relieve some of the burden on the medical system, we have been hired to build a model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia using chest x-ray images. 

Metrics we care about: </br>
- Accuracy </br>
- False Negatives: This matters because we don't want to tell patients they are not sick when they actually are </br>
- False Positives: This matters because the treatment used for bacterial pneumonia is anti-biotics. Antibacterial resistance is becoming a global threat. More and more research is being published on it. Overprescribing antibiotics to patients that don't need them is a big part of this problem that we want to avoid.

## Data

The dataset contains pediatric lung X-Rays from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in Guangzhou, China. This dataset consists of 3 different folders of train, test, and val sets with each folder containing another 2 seperate folders of pneumonia vs normal lung x-ray images. We are using the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) version of this dataset that has 5856 images.
